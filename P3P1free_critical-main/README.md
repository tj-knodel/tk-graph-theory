# P3P1free_critical

The files contain all k-vertex-critical (P_3+P_1)-free graphs for k=4,5,6,7. The graphs are stored line-by-line in graph6 format for compact storage and easy reading. More about the format can be found here: https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/formats.html

The k-vertex-critical graphs are separated into files based on their order. The first number in the file name indicates k and the last indicates the order of the graph.

These correspond to the work done in the following paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00057.pdf and can be used to implement polynomial-time certifying algorithms for k-coloring (P_3+P_1)-free graphs for k=3,4,5,6.
