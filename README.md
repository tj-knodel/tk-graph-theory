# Graph theory 496 2024
A repository for code and other useful items for graph theory research.

The k-critical graph computation is done using Sage. Graphs in g6 format are output by compare_graphs and complement_check. The ruby files contained are helpful scripts for splitting up large g6 files for the purposes of multi-processing (not using the python multiprocessing library, we are doing it the old fashioned way with our friend, &). The rest of the files are various output from the sage files.
